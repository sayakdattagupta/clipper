A simple browser extension that helps you track and manage the last 100 things you have copied in your browser.

### Instructions

Since this is more of a practice thing (my first ever browser extension), I probably willnot publish this as an extension. However, you can run it by cloning the source, and sideloading the manifest.json from your browser settings.

### Known Issues

Only copies things copied using a keystroke (Ctrl+C, for example), or using a mouse - it doesn't copy things copied to clipboard via a script, for example, things copied using a copy button.
